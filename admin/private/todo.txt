Add a "queued" time to each entry in the build queue and use it to stop the fact that building a cheap ship 1 sec before the next tick completes it instantly.
Make buildings take time to build/upgrade. Perhaps make them do nothing while being upgraded?
Add images for buildings and ship hulls.
Add a colony summary to view_planet.php and go there instead of colony_buildings.php when you click on "Details" on the colony list or when you click on the colonised planet in the solar view.
Make new-user sign-up work. Make it bot-proof (recaptcha?)
Add the ability to colonise a planet.
Add the "subspace sensors", and appropriate column on a colony, for detecting incoming enemy fleets. Change view_ships to use that instead of the current hardcoded number.
Add the ability to attack.
Add the ability to recall a fleet.
Change fleet fuel use so it is calculated at fleet creation instead of on every order issued.

Switch to using "systemid,orbit" as the planet key instead of planetid? Would simplify queries that get a colony's location.

Switch to 1-minute ticks?
