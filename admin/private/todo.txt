Add a "queued" time to each entry in the build queue and use it to stop the fact that building a cheap ship 1 sec before the next tick completes it instantly.
Make buildings take time to build/upgrade. Perhaps make them do nothing while being upgraded?
Add images for buildings and ship hulls.
Add a colony summary to view_planet.php.
Make new user registration bot-proof (recaptcha?) (necessary?)
Add the "subspace sensors", and appropriate column on a colony, for detecting incoming enemy fleets. Change view_ships to use that instead of the current hardcoded number.
Add the ability to attack.
Add the ability to recall a fleet.

Switch to using "systemid,orbit" as the planet key instead of planetid? Would simplify queries that get a colony's location.

Switch to 1-minute ticks? /kind of done
Balance colony cost
Either start people with lvl 1 storage or make level 0 storage give space, instead of adding a hard-coded 2000.
